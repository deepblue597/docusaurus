Hello!
This is the first blog by the spacecraft operations team. The goal of this site is to document our app and explain its functionality in order to be used by other ops members in other missions. Our open-source philosophy helps promote the creation of new knowledge and pass it on to anyone that is interested in knowing a bit more about space and the apps that support these kind of missions
